\chapter{Discussion}

This project was focused on understanding how a Large Language Model (LLM) perform after being trained 
for a task such as knowledge graph generation. In order to understand the differences 
between the two models 
-- a specialized model (COMET) and a baseline model (GPT-2 XL) --
we compared their performances for the GLUE benchmark set and arrived at a mixed conclusion. 

For the majority of the GLUE tasks, the models behave very similarly and have comparable performance. The only task where 
COMET model seems to have a lower performance was with the Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability task. In this case, the naive 
GPT-2 XL seems to perform better by a noticeable margin. Upon analyzing the predictions for this task, we noticed that 
COMET model seems to struggle with sentences in the past tense. 

This points us in the right direction for conducting further research. Given the time constraints and the 
computational cost of training and testing LLMs, we had to limit this project to a set of GLUE tasks. 

In the future, it would be valuable to understand how newer models such as GPT-J and GPT-3 change after
they have been trained for knowledge graph generation.
