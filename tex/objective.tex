\chapter{Objective of the project}

The goal of this project is to understand how training(fine-tuning) a large language model such as GPT2-Xl 
to predict tails from a head and a relation \cite{hwang_comet-atomic_2020} can affect its performance 
in other language modelling tasks when compared to its `untrained' version. This will help identify if this kind 
of training leads to a loss or a gain in capability for a language model.
This is done by comparing the performance of the COMET-GPT2-XL\cite{west_symbolic_2021} model against the `naive' 
GPT2-XL on a variety of common modelling tasks and metrics. This project is also a study in how to fit large language
models when dealing with limited compute resources as often encountered in open-source projects.
