\chapter{Objective of the project}

The goal of this project is to understand how training (fine-tuning) a large language model such as GPT-2 XL 
to predict tails from a head and a relation \cite{hwang_comet-atomic_2020} can affect its performance 
in other language modelling tasks when compared to its ``unspecialized'' version. This will help identify if this kind 
of training leads to a loss or a gain in capability for a language model.
This is done by comparing the performance of the COMET-GPT-2 XL\cite{west_symbolic_2021} model against the `naive' 
GPT-2 XL on a variety of common modelling tasks and metrics. Additionally, this project is also a study in how to tune and use 
LLMs when dealing with limited compute resources as is often the case with open-source projects.
