\begin{abstract}
This project was focused on understanding the side effects of "specializing" a large language model 
such as GPT2-XL on the task of Knolwedge Graph Generation. It was theorized that this kind of 
"specialization" may lead to a decrease in the performance of the models in other language 
modelling and understanding tasks such as multiple choice selection, text entailment, word sense
disambiguation and other similar tasks. This comparision was conducted by taking a baseline 
(non-specialized) GPT2-XL model and comparing its performance with a "specialized" GPT2-XL model
used for Knowledge Graph Generation.
