\begin{abstract}
This project focused on understanding the side effects of ``specializing'' a large language model 
such as GPT-2 XL on the task of Knowledge Graph Generation. It was theorized that this kind of 
``specialization'' may lead to a decrease in the performance of the models in other language 
modelling and understanding tasks such as multiple choice selection, text entailment, word sense
disambiguation and other similar tasks. In order to compare the performance of the models, 
a specialized model (COMET) was compared with a baseline model (GPT-2 XL) on several  
general language tasks. The specialized model was ``fully trained'' on the task of Knowledge Graph
generation while the baseline model was not. Both models had their base layers frozen and only
the language modelling head was trained on the respective tasks. The results of the experiments
indicate that the specialized model does not perform as well as the baseline model on some tasks.
