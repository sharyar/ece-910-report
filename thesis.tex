%% Correct title for TOC
\renewcommand{\contentsname}{Table of Contents}

% Fill in the following
\title{Thesis Title} % Title can't use formulae, symbols, superscripts, subscripts, greek letters, etc. all of which should be replaced with word substitutes
\author{Author Name}

\degree{\MSc}
%\degree{\PhD} % uncomment respective degree

\dept{Computing Science}  % Write Computing Science or Civil Engineering.

% If you have a specialization, uncomment the following line and enter it below.
% It must correspond with what it says on Bear Tracks
% (Academics>My Academics>Graduation). If, like most people, you don't have one,
% just leave it commented.
%\field{Specialization Field}

% Put the year that you submitted your thesis below

% Document Content  %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% This is a modular document.
% The 'subfiles' package allows you to typeset the included
% documents separately from the main document, so that you
% can view only pieces of the thesis at a time.
% See https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Modular_Documents
%
% Subfiles that contain references: You can just run
% `biber subfilename` on them when compiling them individually.
% There is no need to make them reference the bibliography database
% 'refs.bib', as they inherit the reference from this file.
